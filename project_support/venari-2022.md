# Introduction
Venari is a team who had lots of modifications on their plan. The historical
background is that they are pressured by invertors, pushing them to deliver
an ever-changing product.

Here it's exposed what we've learn from that experience

## Learning time!

### Technology expertise
Everybody has to be honest with their expertise level. We were told to use a
stack imperatively, and that couldn't be changed because our team has hired
a external consultor which gave NO warrant about that technologies to end up
working (not any PoC or real case example). We learned what we could, but
nobody knew about **crateDB** or **Apache storm**

### Lack of ownership
We want to deliver the best quality in the least amount of time, this has
been specially hard as we couldn't give a word but work on a stack that has
been abandoned to us.
Next time it's crucial that a step forward is made to change "what has been
decided previously". 

### Bad habits
We worked more hours than we should and the deadlines were not serious. This
has also led us to a crysis-mode, also the client had assumed that we'd be
up all the time at any moment to fit their needs. It's a honor to stay some
more hours to complete a task, but when it's a habit people are deemed.

### No planning / framework
We also didn't have any kind of data (or test data) until the very last
moment, this had lead us to building things half blindfolded, the tasks were
done without thinking about it's dependencies or impact in the whole
application. As the pressure was extremely high from the client. Learn to
say NO or STOP!

### Unclear goals
As there wasn't any propper roadmap and the client had lots of changes in
little time this has lead to all the team not having any sense of giving
value, the apathy can be really bad when working under pressure and also
spreads really fast among team members.
Answer yourself this question while in a project: Â¿What's the value I'm giving by
doing these tasks?
